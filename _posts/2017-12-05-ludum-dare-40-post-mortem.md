&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ludum Dare is a weekend game jam that runs every 4 months. On the weekend of
December 1st, 2017 I particpiated in my first game jam. I would be lying if I
did not say that I failed. A video of what I was able to create is posted below.

# Inspiration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke up an hour after the jam started. I grabbed some food, excited to see the
theme. My excited was swiftly removed from the sight of the theme "The more you
have, the worse it is". My first thought was the I wanted to make something with
RTS controls, so I went with that. How to make a game fit the theme? Choose a
control scheme that fits the theme and make whatever. I set forth to make a
survival game where you manage units to maintain enough resources to keep them
alive and kill some common enemy. 
# Failure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not able to complete a game to publish to the jam website. For this
reason I count this attempt as a failure, but what went wrong? On the first day
of development I spent too much time trying to get simple font rendering with
alignment. I thought this would be useful for debugging, but I only really text
in game to debug unit movement.

![debugging movement]({{ "/data/ld40/ahhhhhhh_walkable_tiles.png" | absolute_url }})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest time sink of the project was art. I spent hours using circles to draw
figures. I struggled to create anything that I liked. Finally, I settled on just
using whatever assets I could get in the game as placeholder.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code is not maintainable. Making a game in 48 hours is hard, and it
would be difficult to make a complete, robust, engine. I should have stubbed
out more of the features. This would make it easier to go back to the
project later. As it stands I doubt I will understand the code a month from
now without reading more than I should need to. 
# Success?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have wanted to compete in Ludum Dare for years. This is the first time I
have taken the time to actually make something. The jam was great fun, and I
will definitely be competing in the next one. For now I am going to take a break
and work on pracitcing some art. In a few weeks I will find another jam to
participate in, and then another. More practice = More skill (hopefully).
# Process 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love watching timelapses from Ludum Dare, but I did not record my
development. I did take screenshots along the way. All pictures are posted
below.
